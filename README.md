Run the Timeline_reconstruction.py for the timeline recosntruction and Automated_report.py file for generating the automated forensics report.

Avoid the other python files as they are only for testing certain things.

The reports are the previously generated reports and if you run the pipeline again they will be overwritten or you can delete them and generate the reports again.
